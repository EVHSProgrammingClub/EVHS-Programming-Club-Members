# Lavalink 3.3

Basically because the `Lavalink.jar` is too big, can't upload via GUI (and too lazy to clone the repo), so just go find [Lavalink.jar here](https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1)
- `cd ./lib/Lavalink3.3`
- `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
