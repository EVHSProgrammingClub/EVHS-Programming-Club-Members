## PostalService requires a database to function. Currently MySQL is supported.
database:
    user: root
    password: 1234
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 3306
    database: someName

## Here you can enable or disable each type of mail
# PostalService has 4 mail types built-in:
#   Letters - Text only messages
#   Package - In-game Items
#   Payment - Money/Currency (requires Vault)
#   Xp      - XP points (not levels)
enabled-mail-types:
    letter: true
    package: true
    payment: true
    xp: true
     
## Toggle the use of UUIDs
# If disabled, PostalService will track player data using
# player names. If the server is running in offline mode,
# UUIDs will automatically be disabled. To force the use of
# UUIDS in offline mode, set this to "always". 
use-uuids: true

## Toggle on or off the update checker
# If the update checker finds an update, it will notify players with the
# postalservice.update permission when they login.
#
# You can also choose to have new versions auto downloaded as well.
# There are 3 auto download settings you can choose from:
#   - all: This will download all updates as they become available.
#   - bugfix: This will only download bugfix updates to your current version,
#             and you will have to manually update for feature upates.
#   - none: This will disable auto downloading for all updates.

# World Settings #
##################

## World groups allow you to segregate where mail items can be claimed. 
# This is useful if you have worlds with different inventories and you don't want
# players sending things across universes.
# For example, mail sent from a world in a "Survival Universe" would not be
# claimable from a world in a "PvP Universe".
# You can define as many groups as you like. Each group name must be 
# different from one another.

enable-world-groups: false

world-groups:
#    Survival Universe:
#      - survival_main
#      - survival_main_nether
#
#    Some Other Group:
#      - another_world

## Here you can set certain mail types to ignore world groups and 
# be claimable in all worlds.
# For example, say all your universes share the same economy. 
# In this case, you may want Payments to ignore world groups so players can 
# send money across universes but may want Packages to stay within world groups 
# so items can't be shared.
mail-types-that-ignore-world-groups:
#   - payment
  
## Worlds listed in this blacklist prevent players from running any PostalService 
# commands or opening mailboxes.
# This includes the ability to check mail, send mail, create mailboxes, etc.
world-blacklist:
  - worldname
