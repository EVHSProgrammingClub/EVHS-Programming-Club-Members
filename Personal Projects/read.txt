This is for your personal projects.

1. Make a folder with your first name. 
2. Inside the folder, make a yourname.md file and put
  - your first and last name
  - your grade
  - something about you
  - fav color
  - programming languages you know
(if you do know how md files work, feel free to make this prettier)
3. Put your personal project in here. (or files with links to your repo on github)
4. Thats all for now!
